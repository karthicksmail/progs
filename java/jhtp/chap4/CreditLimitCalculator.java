/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * (Credit Limit Calculator) Develop a Java application that determines whether any of several department-store customers has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account.
 * For each customer, the following facts are available:
 * 	* account number
 *	* balance at the beginning of the month
 *	* total of all items charged by the customer this month
 *	* total of all credits applied to the customerâ€™s account this month
 *	* allowed credit limit.
 * The program should input all these facts as integers, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + charges â€“ credits), display the new balance and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customerâ€™s credit limit.
 * For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the message "Credit limit exceeded".
